# GO Proxmox

GO Proxmox is a Go client library for interacting with the Proxmox VE API.
It provides a simple and efficient way to manage Proxmox virtual environments programmatically using Go.

It reuses the excellent [Go-Proxmox](https://github.com/luthermonson/go-proxmox) library as its foundation.
